**"Quantum Free Energy Profiles for Molecular Proton Transfers"**

by Aran Lamaire, Maarten Cools-Ceuppens, Massimo Bocus, Toon Verstraelen, and Veronique Van Speybroeck.

This work was published in the *Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation*, **2023**, *19* (1): 18-24 (DOI: [10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00874](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00874)).

For each molecular proton transfer, the machine learning potential (MLP) is given in the respective directory (as [NNFFLIB](https://github.com/mcoolsce/NNFFLIB) input).
